## üèÜ **TOP TIER FEATURES (Importance > 0.05)**
*These are the fraud detection powerhouses*

### **#1. amount_vs_pair_avg (Importance: 0.181)**
**What it is**: Ratio of current transaction amount to historical average between this sender-receiver pair
**Why it's critical**: 
- **Fraud pattern**: Fraudsters often send unusual amounts compared to normal relationship patterns
- **Example**: If Alice usually sends Bob $20-50, but suddenly sends $2000, this ratio spikes
- **Account takeover detection**: Legitimate relationships have consistent amount patterns
- **Business logic**: Same amount can be normal for one pair, suspicious for another

### **#2. pair_total_amount (Importance: 0.100)**
**What it is**: Total cumulative amount ever exchanged between this sender-receiver pair
**Why it's important**:
- **Relationship depth**: High total amounts suggest established, legitimate relationships
- **Money mule detection**: New relationships with high volumes are suspicious
- **Trust indicator**: Families/friends build up transaction history over time
- **Fraud rings**: Often have artificially low cumulative amounts (new connections)

### **#3. pair_familiarity_score (Importance: 0.093)**
**What it is**: Combined metric: transaction_count √ó log(total_amount) between pair
**Why it's powerful**:
- **Relationship strength**: Captures both frequency AND volume of interactions
- **Fraud vs legitimate**: Real relationships have both multiple transactions AND meaningful amounts
- **Money laundering**: Quick, high-volume transfers lack familiarity depth
- **Social network authenticity**: Genuine social connections build familiarity over time

### **#4. pair_avg_amount (Importance: 0.075)**
**What it is**: Average transaction amount between this specific sender-receiver pair
**Why it matters**:
- **Pattern consistency**: Real relationships have consistent spending patterns
- **Behavioral baseline**: Each relationship has its own "normal" transaction size
- **Anomaly detection**: Deviations from pair-specific averages signal potential fraud
- **Context-aware**: $100 might be normal for some pairs, unusual for others

### **#5. is_first_interaction (Importance: 0.070)**
**What it is**: Binary indicator if this is the first transaction between these accounts
**Why it's crucial**:
- **Risk factor**: First-time interactions carry higher fraud risk
- **Social engineering**: Fraudsters often target new connections
- **Money mule recruitment**: Initial transactions in mule networks
- **Trust building**: Legitimate relationships typically start small, build gradually

### **#6. pair_tx_count (Importance: 0.058)**
**What it is**: Number of previous transactions between this sender-receiver pair
**Why it's significant**:
- **Relationship age**: More transactions = more established relationship
- **Fraud pattern**: Many fraud schemes involve minimal transaction history
- **Trust proxy**: People rarely transact repeatedly with strangers
- **Network analysis**: Core to understanding relationship strength

## ü•â **SUPPORTING FEATURES (Importance: 0.01-0.02)**
*Useful context and refinement signals*

### **Account History Features**
- **receiver_avg_amount (0.015)**: Average amounts this receiver typically gets
- **sender_total_amt (0.014)**: Total volume this sender has ever sent
- **sender_avg_amount (0.012)**: Average amounts this sender typically sends
- **receiver_total_amt (0.011)**: Total volume this receiver has ever received

- **Supporting context**: Useful in combination with other features

---

## üéØ **KEY INSIGHTS FROM FEATURE IMPORTANCE**

### **1. Relationships Trump Individual Behavior**
The top 6 features are all **pair-based** (relationship features), not individual account features. This tells us:
- **Fraud is relational**: It's not just about unusual amounts, but unusual amounts *for that relationship*
- **Context matters**: The same transaction can be normal or suspicious depending on the relationship
- **Network approach wins**: Graph-based features should provide significant additional value

### **2. Amount Context > Raw Amounts**
- **amount_vs_pair_avg (0.181)** massively outperforms **raw amount (0.028)**
- **Lesson**: "Unusual for this relationship" is more predictive than "large amount"
- **Implication**: Personalized baselines are crucial for fraud detection

### **3. Relationship History is Protective**
- **pair_familiarity_score** and **pair_tx_count** are highly predictive
- **First interactions** are much riskier than established relationships
- **Trust building**: Legitimate relationships develop transaction history gradually

### **4. Temporal Features Underperform**
- Weekend/night indicators have very low importance (< 0.002)
- **Insight**: *When* transactions happen matters less than *who* is involved and *how much*
- **Focus**: Relationship and amount patterns are more important than timing

### **5. Feature Engineering Success**
- Derived features (**amount_vs_pair_avg**, **pair_familiarity_score**) dominate raw features
- **Validation**: Our sophisticated feature engineering captured real fraud signals
- **Graph potential**: If pair-level features work this well, network-level features should add significant value

## üîÆ **Predictions for Phase 2 (Graph Embeddings)**

Based on these importance rankings, graph embeddings should help by:

### **Expected High-Value Graph Features**
1. **Account similarity embeddings**: Find accounts with similar network positions (money mules cluster together)
2. **Structural role features**: Detect accounts that act as hubs, bridges, or isolated nodes
3. **Community detection**: Identify tight fraud rings vs. loose legitimate networks
4. **Path-based features**: Multi-hop relationship patterns (friend-of-friend connections)

### **Why Graph Should Beat Tabular**
- **Current limit**: We only see direct pair relationships
- **Graph advantage**: Can capture indirect relationships, network roles, community structures
- **Fraud patterns**: Money mule networks, fraud rings show clear network signatures
- **Expected improvement**: Target >0.159 PR-AUC (current baseline)

## üìà **Feature Development Recommendations**

### **For Phase 2 Graph Features**
1. **Focus on relationship patterns**: Since pair features dominate, network features should too
2. **Embedding similarity**: Compare sender/receiver embeddings for relationship authenticity
3. **Network roles**: Identify structural positions (central hubs, connectors, isolates)
4. **Community features**: Measure how "tight" the sender-receiver community is

### **For Future Iterations**
1. **More pair-level features**: Since these perform best, develop more relationship-specific metrics
2. **Dynamic relationship features**: How relationships change over time
3. **Cross-relationship features**: How behavior in one relationship affects others
4. **Network neighborhood features**: Properties of accounts connected to sender/receiver
